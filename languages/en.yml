    The %s clearly doesn't measure up to the competition.
    Even if it were free, I wouldn't want it.
  LABEL_CUSTOM_PLATFORM_FEEDBACK_DESCRIPTION_20_39: |
    %s is making an effort, but there's still a long way to go.

    %s is released a few years late.
    Technologically speaking, this console will have trouble playing the latest games.
    This console's market share is unlikely to exceed the peanuts.
  LABEL_CUSTOM_PLATFORM_FEEDBACK_DESCRIPTION_40_59: |
    %s offers a choice - not the best, surely, but it's there.

    %s is one of the least powerful consoles on the market.
    Sure, it can run the latest games, but a little more power under the hood wouldn't have gone amiss.
    It's going to take an exceptional catalog of games for this console's market share to take off.
  LABEL_CUSTOM_PLATFORM_FEEDBACK_DESCRIPTION_60_79: |
    %s is there, making its mark in the industry. %s offers interesting performance.

    It's not exactly the best on the market, but with the right price and a decent catalog of games, this console could achieve a decent market share.
  LABEL_CUSTOM_PLATFORM_FEEDBACK_DESCRIPTION_80_100: |
    %s has created a nugget for us.

    The %s is a next-gen console.
    Not only does it run the latest games, it has a bright future ahead of it.
    With the right price and a decent catalog of games, this console could become a cult.

    The workload for this gauge could be improved
  LABEL_GAUGE_POOR: |
    Wrong estimation of the workload needed for this gauge
  LABEL_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY: Backwards compatibility
  TOOLTIP_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY: |
    In order to make a backwards-compatible console, it's necessary that you have already made a console of the same kind.
    Meaning, if you make a handheld console, and you want to make it backwards compatible,
    then you need a handheld console that you have made before.
    It is backwards compatible with the last console of the same kind that you have designed.

    Being backwards compatible makes it faster and better to port games from the predecessor console.
    On the other hand, it requires a lot of development points to achieve the current console.

    It is not possible to make a console backwards compatible if you have not released a console of the same genre before.

  LABEL_GRANTENDO_DENY_PARTNERSHIP: "Grantendo/Deny partnership"
  LABEL_GRANTENDO_DENY_PROTOTYPE_ANNOUNCEMENT: |
    The word is in, and that word is CD-ROM for the [b]Super Grantendo[/b]! [b]Grantendo[/b] announced that a CD-ROM drive for use with the [b]Super Grantendo[/b] would be introduced in January of 1993. Shortly thereafter, [b]Grantendo[/b]'s third-party licensee developers received technical specification for the new drive and were invited to a conference devoted to explaining the new hardware in detail. There they will learn about the outstanding capabilities of the Super GES CD-ROM drive including full-screen, full-motion video, XA compatibility and the unit's 8 megs of RAM. Unless you're an engineer, however, much of that technical jargon might not mean much.

    [center][img]res://texture/platforms/512x261/grantendo-gamestation.tex[/img][/center]
  LABEL_GRANTENDO_DENY_PROTOTYPE_CANCELATION: |
    A day after [b]Deny[/b] announced a deal with [b]Grantendo[/b], to make electronic game consoles, [b]Grantendo[/b] announced that it had struck a deal with [b]Moris[/b], one of [b]Deny[/b]'s principal rivals.

    The [b]Grantendo[/b] Company evidently turned to [b]Moris[/b], the Dutch electronics giant, to try to maintain its domination of the $4.7 billion video game market after signing what some experts say is an unfavorable deal wit the [b]Deny[/b] Corporation.

    For consumers the result is another confusing choice when the game consoles reach the martket next year.

    [b]Deny[/b] plans to release its own games on compact disks for the [b]GameStation[/b]. The [b]Moris[/b] announcements and the ensuing confusion over [b]Grantendo[/b]'s relationship with [b]Deny[/b] upstaged [b]Grantendo[/b]'s long-planned introduction of a more powerful version of its popular video game system.

  LABEL_SAGA_PROTYPE_VR: "Saga announces the first VR console"
  LABEL_SAGA_RV_ANNOUNCEMENT: |
    Virtual reality.

    Starting with the science-fiction concept of computer operators immersing themselves in an artificial environment, the term virtual reality (or VR) has been adopted by the marketing community and applied in varying degrees of appropriateness to everything from Virtuality game centers to the latest first-person perspective game. Purists contend that it should at least provide a 3-D audio-visual environment that appears to surround the player and with which he or she can interact.

    [center][img]res://texture/platforms/512x261/saga-rv.tex[/img][/center]

    [b]Saga[/b] announced a VR helmet in the works, for use with its console system. It's currently scheduled for release in [b]spring 1993[/b]. There are far more elaborate (and costly) systems under development, involving motion sensors and gauntlets, chambers with surrounding video and multi-source sound. For the time being the gaming community may have to settle for goggles and earphones at home.
  LABEL_SAGA_RV_VANISHES: |
    After being featured in several magazines, as well as at numerous trade shows, the headset made its final appearance in 1993. It was shown behind closed doors to a thoroughly underwhelmed audience, with one journalist writer describing the game he played as an unresponsive blur which quickly lost any and all appeal.

    The whole project never progressed beyond the prototype stage and [b]Saga[/b] officially claimed that it was halted due to users hurting themselves by moving while wearing the headset. They stated that the sense of immersion was so realistic, it could potentially cause injury to children who played it.

    However, anyone who has played their console for more than ten minutes knows that this is impossible, given the limitations of the hardware. The most likely scenario probably had to do with the unit's inability to produce a satisfactory effect. There were reports of testers getting motion sickness while playing and up to 40%% of the users during development got "cybersick." None of the four announced games were ever shown to the public and no other titles were ever announced. Unable to create the true, lifelike sense of immersion they had promised, [b]Saga[/b] wisely pulled the plug in 1994 and [b]Saga[/b] VR faded quietly into obscurity.

    Hi,
    I am Bruno Trigger. Every Wednesday I host the show [i]3615 Dorian[/i] about independent video games. 
    As a big fan of [b]%s[/b] I'd like to ask you a few questions for our big game night of [b]%s[/b].
    Do you have 5 minutes?
  LABEL_INTERVIEW_INDIE_QUESTION: |
    I dream of embarking on the adventure of independent game development! Being my own boss and responding to a loving and caring community, what a dream!
    Our small community being fans of [b]%s[/b] games, what do you think we should focus on if we want to make a game?

    [b]%s[/b] has to have a crystal ball! Predicting in anticipation who will be nominated Game of the Year is not easy!
    To be that farsighted, they have to know the inner workings of the industry!
  LABEL_INTERVIEW_BIG_ANSWER_WRONG: |
    Anyone can be wrong, you, me, everyone.One thing is certain, however, [b]%s[/b] has not been able to predict the future!
    People learn more from their mistakes than from their successes. In any case, this is something we probably hear a lot at [b]%s[/b].

  LABEL_VIDEO_GAME_KRACH_1983_DESCRIPTION: |
    After the poor results in the last quarter of 1982 and early 1983, Wataggi announces declining results
    in the console market. The leader in video games is far from reaching its objectives by selling a few
    hundred consoles and barely some 2500 cassettes. The health report is also largely negative as far as
    home computers are concerned, which confirms the uncertainties that characterize this market today.

    The major players in the video game industry are expecting difficult months ahead and there is no
    indication today that things will improve.
  LABEL_VIDEO_GAME_KRACH_1983_TITLE: |
    The market is collapsing
  LABEL_VIDEO_GAME_PREKRACH_1983_DESCRIPTION: |
    In the middle of the summer, Wataggi, the leader in the video game market, announced losses of $356 million.
    Plastics was experiencing very serious difficulties and was withdrawing from the market. The rumor was that
    the video game market was collapsing to make way for microcomputers.

    In fact, the losses of Wataggi and Plastics, relayed by the fall of the shares on the New York Stock Exchange,
    created an unjustified panic. With 2 billion dollars in annual sales in the United States, video games remain
    a solid industry. But the spectacular growth of the last two years has levelled off somewhat. The market is
    moving both up-market, where Roberto Industries' RobertoVision console competes with home microcomputers -
    and down-market, for devices with a satisfactory price/performance ratio.

    Bonus hype is generated when showing off your game at conventions.
  TOOLTIP_CUSTOM_PLATFORM_RELEASE: |
    Congratulations, you've just developed your console!

    Before publishing it, it's important to build up a decent catalog of games.
    To this end, consider signing exclusive contracts with your competitors.
    Alternatively, release a bunch of small games yourself.
    Of course, there's always the option of acting as a publisher by hiring
    small independent studios to make games for you.

    All things considered, it's best to have at least 15 games before publishing
    your first console.
  TOOLTIP_UNIVERSITY_TRAINING: |

    Make your own game engine.

    If you create a proprietary engine you can sell it with a license.

    Another option is to keep it in-house so competitors don't get an advantage.
  TOOLTIP_TRADE_PUBLISH_WHY: |
    Create games for competitors.

    You' re going to acquire a lot of new fans quickly.

  TUTORIEL_PLATFORM_MAKING_COSTS: |

    Since you don't have enough fans to be able to sell games of this size,
    you will need to have a rating above 90% to be successful.

    To grow your fan base, you can also take offers to publish from other companies.
